Whenever we have to fetch columnS from different table, we join 2 tables
- We need to have a common column


In inner join , we get matching rows

SQL

INNER JOIN

SELECT Cust_ID, Sales, Email_id, Name
FROM Transaction_table INNER JOIN Customer_Table
ON Cust_id = ID


LEFT JOIN

We get all the rows from the left table and matching rows from right table

SELECT Cust_ID, Sales, Email_id, Name
FROM Transaction_table LEFT JOIN Customer_Table
ON Cust_id = ID

RIGHT JOIN

We get all the rows from the RIGHT table and matching rows from LEFT table

SELECT Cust_ID, Sales, Email_id, Name
FROM Transaction_table RIGHT JOIN Customer_Table
ON Cust_id = ID
